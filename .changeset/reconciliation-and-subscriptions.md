Reconcile the documented API with the implementation and add streaming GraphQL
subscriptions to the NestJS integration.

While Leaven is pre-1.0 these releases are versioned `minor`, so the entries
below include **breaking changes**. Read them before upgrading.

### Breaking changes

- **`@leaven-graphql/http` — `buildResponse` status mapping.** HTTP status codes
  are now derived from `ERROR_CODES` instead of an inline table, so some error
  responses return a different status than before. Clients that branch on the
  status of a GraphQL error response should be re-checked.
- **`@leaven-graphql/nestjs` — `SubscriptionManager.publish` renamed to
  `publishToTopic`.** The new method keys on a **server-side topic** rather than
  the client-supplied operation id, so a single publish fans out to every
  subscriber of the topic. `publish` remains as a `@deprecated` shim that
  forwards to `publishToTopic`; it will be removed in a future release. Note
  this is the `SubscriptionManager` in `@leaven-graphql/nestjs`, not the
  same-named class in `@leaven-graphql/ws`, which has neither method.
- **`@leaven-graphql/nestjs` — `GqlExecutionContext` path accessors.**
  `getPath()` keeps returning `string[]` (field names only). The new
  `getFullPath()` returns the complete response path *including list indices*.
  Code that expected indices from `getPath()` must move to `getFullPath()`.
- **`@leaven-graphql/nestjs` — subscription filters now actually filter.**
  `@SubscriptionFilter` and `@Subscription({ filter })` wrap the decorated
  method and filter the events it yields. Previously-registered filters that
  were no-ops will start suppressing events.
- **`@leaven-graphql/nestjs` — `LeavenModuleAsyncOptions` is now a discriminated
  union.** Exactly one of `useFactory`, `useClass`, or `useExisting` must be
  supplied; objects that set several (or none) no longer type-check.
- **`@leaven-graphql/nestjs` — driver error code renamed.**
  `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` is now `INTERNAL_ERROR`.
- **`@leaven-graphql/nestjs` — CORS is opt-in.** The GraphQL middleware emits no
  `Access-Control-*` headers unless `LeavenModuleOptions.cors` is set to `true`
  or an options object, and leaves `OPTIONS` preflights to the application. A
  stock `LeavenModule.forRoot({ schema })` no longer answers every GraphQL POST
  with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. Deployments that relied on the previous
  always-on default must now set `cors` explicitly. When it *is* enabled, the
  allowed origin is reflected rather than defaulted to `*` whenever an
  allowlist is configured, `Vary: Origin` is emitted whenever the value depends
  on the request, and `*` is never paired with `credentials: true`.
- **`@leaven-graphql/ws` — `WebSocketContext.connectionId` is now an opaque
  UUIDv4.** It was previously a parseable `Date.now()`-prefixed string. Treat it
  as an opaque identifier: do **not** parse it, sort by it, or derive a
  connection timestamp from it.
- **`@leaven-graphql/plugins` — complexity scores changed.** Pagination
  arguments supplied as variables are now resolved (previously they fell back to
  a fixed multiplier of `10`), non-positive literals are rejected instead of
  driving scores negative, and multipliers compound across nesting. An
  unresolvable page size uses the new `unknownMultiplier` option (default
  `100`). **Existing `maxComplexity` budgets will need raising.**
- **`@leaven-graphql/plugins` — `createCachingPlugin` requires an explicit cache
  key policy.** It now throws unless given either a `keyFn` or
  `allowSharedCache: true`. The default key never contained user or tenant
  identity, so responses could be served across callers; opting in is now
  deliberate.
- **`@leaven-graphql/core` — `CompiledQuery` no longer inlines fragment
  spreads.** `CompiledField.children` excludes fragment fields, which are
  reachable via the new `CompiledField.fragmentSpreads` and
  `CompiledQuery.fragments`; `getFieldNames()` now returns distinct names. This
  is what makes fragment analysis linear rather than exponential.
- **`@leaven-graphql/core` — query analysis is bounded.** Depth and complexity
  analysis now abort with an error once a document exceeds an internal visit
  budget, so a small document with deeply fanned-out fragments can no longer
  consume unbounded CPU and memory.
- **Removed options.** Five inert options have been **removed** from their
  interfaces rather than deprecated. They previously type-checked and did
  nothing; under `strict` an object literal that still sets one is now an
  excess-property compile error, so this surfaces at build time rather than
  silently.
  - `@leaven-graphql/core`: `CompilerOptions.cacheHints` — there is no
    field-level cache-hint mechanism to enable. Delete the property.
  - `@leaven-graphql/core`: `ParseOptions.cache` — document caching is
    configured on the executor via `ExecutorConfig.cache`, never here. Delete
    the property and set `cache` on `LeavenExecutor` instead.
  - `@leaven-graphql/http`: `ResponseOptions.cors` — `buildResponse` never read
    it. Build the headers with the exported `corsHeaders(request, config)` and
    pass them through `ResponseOptions.headers`, or set `cors` on the handler /
    server config, which does apply them.
  - `@leaven-graphql/schema`: `MergeOptions.includeBuiltInDirectives` and
    `MergeOptions.typeMerger` — neither was ever consulted. `MergeOptions` now
    has exactly one member, `onTypeConflict`. There is no replacement for
    `typeMerger`; use `onTypeConflict` plus the `resolvers` argument to
    `mergeSchemas`.
- **`@leaven-graphql/schema` — a failed merge now throws.** When the merged SDL
  cannot be built into a schema, `mergeSchemas`/`mergeSchemasFromStrings` throw
  `Failed to merge schemas: …` (with the underlying error as `cause`). They
  previously swallowed the failure and fell back to concatenating the raw type
  definitions, producing a schema that was wrong in a different way.
- **`@leaven-graphql/schema` — mismatched type kinds now throw.** If two source
  schemas declare the same type name as different kinds (a custom scalar in one,
  an object type in the other), `mergeSchemas` fails at composition time instead
  of yielding a schema that misbehaves per request.

### Fixes

- **`@leaven-graphql/http` — multipart `map` paths are restricted.** A file path
  in a `multipart/form-data` upload must now start with `variables` or
  `operations`, and no segment may be `__proto__`, `constructor`, or
  `prototype`. Intermediates are created with a null prototype and traversal
  uses `hasOwnProperty` rather than `in`. An unauthenticated request mapping a
  file to `__proto__.polluted` previously wrote straight into
  `Object.prototype`. Paths outside those roots are now dropped.
- **`@leaven-graphql/http` — `errorFormatting` no longer destroys execution
  errors.** The executor hands back already-formatted errors, and passing one of
  those to `formatError` stringified it to `"[object Object]"`. Each error is
  now rebuilt into a `GraphQLError` before formatting, so messages, codes, and
  extensions survive.
- **`@leaven-graphql/http` — partial successes stay 200.** A response that
  carries `data` alongside `errors` is a spec-conformant partial success and now
  keeps its 200 status even when the errors carry codes that map to a 4xx/5xx.
  Only a total failure (`data` absent or `null`) derives its status from the
  first error's code. Clients no longer discard data they were handed as though
  the request had failed.
- **`@leaven-graphql/http` — `maxBodySize` has a default.** Request bodies are
  now capped at 1,000,000 bytes unless `HandlerConfig.maxBodySize` says
  otherwise; the limit was previously unbounded when the option was omitted. It
  is enforced both from `Content-Length` and while reading the stream, since the
  header may be absent, malformed, or lying, and an oversized body is rejected
  with `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` (HTTP 413).
- **`@leaven-graphql/ws` — subscriptions are keyed per connection.**
  `SubscriptionManager` now stores subscriptions as `connectionId ->
  subscriptionId -> Subscription`. graphql-ws operation ids are unique only
  *within* a connection — reference clients use a per-connection counter
  starting at `"1"` — so the previous flat map let one connection's `subscribe`
  clobber another's, and one connection's `complete` tear another's down.
- **`@leaven-graphql/ws` — queries and mutations are accepted over
  graphql-ws.** A `Subscribe` frame is the graphql-ws transport for *every*
  operation, not just subscriptions. Single-result operations are now routed to
  `SubscriptionManager.execute` on the same executor, so both transports honour
  the same limits and share the same caches. They previously failed with
  "Schema is not configured to execute subscription operation."
- **`@leaven-graphql/core` — `maxDepth` is part of the validation-cache
  fingerprint.** The document cache key now covers the effective parser options,
  including a `maxDepth` configured on the executor. A document parsed under a
  permissive `maxDepth` could previously be served from cache to an executor
  configured with a strict one, whose depth check never re-ran.
- **`@leaven-graphql/core` — `subscribe()` returns errors instead of throwing.**
  Validation failures and non-iterable subscription results now come back as a
  `GraphQLResponse` carrying `errors`, so transports can forward them to the
  client rather than crashing the connection.
- **`@leaven-graphql/core` — `subscribe()` now enforces the same limits as
  `execute()`.** Both run one shared pipeline (parse → validate → compile →
  complexity) and fire the same hooks. A `maxComplexity` or `maxDepth` budget
  previously applied only to queries and mutations, leaving subscriptions —
  the longest-lived operations — unmeasured. Documents that were accepted
  before may now be rejected.
- **`@leaven-graphql/ws` — `SubscriptionManager` is keyed per connection.**
  `unsubscribe(connectionId, subscriptionId)` and
  `getSubscription(connectionId, subscriptionId)` now require both arguments.
  Subscriptions were previously stored in one global map keyed by the
  client-chosen operation id, which is only unique per connection — so two
  clients both using `"1"` clobbered each other, and one disconnecting
  silently killed the other's stream.
- **`@leaven-graphql/nestjs` — `introspection` and `maxDepth` are now
  forwarded to the executor.** Both options were accepted and silently
  discarded. `introspection: false` genuinely blocks `__schema` queries now
  (previously it did nothing, leaving the schema exposed in production), and
  `maxDepth` is enforced by the executor rather than only by an optional
  guard.
- **`@leaven-graphql/schema` — `mergeSchemas` no longer drops type extensions.**
  The extension-kind check tested `startsWith('TypeExtension')`, which never
  matches (the AST kinds *end* with it, e.g. `ObjectTypeExtension`), so every
  `extend type …` was treated as a conflicting redefinition and discarded under
  the default `'first'` policy. Fields contributed by `extend type Query { … }`
  and friends now survive the merge.
- **`@leaven-graphql/leaven` — invalid subpath exports removed.** The package
  declared `./core`, `./schema`, `./http`, `./ws`, `./context`, `./errors`,
  `./plugins`, and `./playground`, each targeting a bare package specifier.
  `exports` targets must start with `./`, so every one of those subpaths failed
  to resolve — `ERR_INVALID_PACKAGE_TARGET` under Node, "Cannot find module"
  under Bun. They have been removed; the package has a single entry point.
  Import the scoped packages directly for anything the barrel does not
  re-export.
- **`@leaven-graphql/schema` — `mergeSchemas` re-attaches executable
  functions.** Merging round-trips through SDL, which drops everything that is
  not a type definition. Field `resolve`/`subscribe`, `isTypeOf`, `resolveType`,
  and custom scalar `serialize`/`parseValue`/`parseLiteral` are now copied back
  onto the merged schema, with `onTypeConflict` deciding which source wins.

### New features

- **`@leaven-graphql/errors` — `ErrorCode.PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`.** A new code
  registered in `ERROR_CODES` with `status: 413`, emitted by
  `@leaven-graphql/http` for oversized request bodies.
- **Streaming GraphQL subscriptions over WebSocket in
  `@leaven-graphql/nestjs`.** Subscription resolvers can return an
  `AsyncIterable` and have its events streamed to subscribers over the
  `graphql-ws` transport.
- **PubSub dependency injection.** Inject the configured PubSub instance with
  `@InjectPubSub()` or the `LEAVEN_PUBSUB` token.
- **New module options.** `LeavenModuleOptions.subscriptions` configures the
  WebSocket subscription transport, and `LeavenModuleOptions.pubSub` supplies the
  PubSub implementation to register for injection.

### Deprecated (accepted, but no longer functional)

These options still type-check and are marked `@deprecated`; they are ignored at
runtime and will be removed in a future release.

- `@leaven-graphql/schema`: `LoaderOptions.encoding` — files are always read as
  UTF-8.
- `@leaven-graphql/nestjs`: `LeavenModuleOptions.plugins`,
  `LeavenModuleOptions.sortSchema`, `LeavenModuleOptions.buildSchemaOptions`,
  `LeavenModuleOptions.debug`
