/**
 * @leaven-graphql/nestjs - Subscriptions Support
 *
 * Provides graphql-ws protocol handling over WebSocket for NestJS.
 *
 * Single-result operations (queries and mutations) are answered with one
 * `next` message followed by `complete`. Streaming `subscription` operations
 * are executed through the Leaven executor and each event is forwarded as a
 * `next` message until the stream ends, the client sends `complete`, or the
 * connection closes. Topic-keyed delivery driven by an external pub/sub
 * engine is available via `SubscriptionManager.registerSubscription` and
 * `SubscriptionManager.publishToTopic`.
 *
 * TRANSPORT: this module speaks the protocol, it does NOT own a server. Two
 * equivalent entry points are provided, one per socket shape:
 *
 * - A DOM-shaped `WebSocket` (`addEventListener`) — hand it to
 *   `SubscriptionManager.handleConnection` and the manager wires its own
 *   listeners.
 * - A Bun `ServerWebSocket` (no `addEventListener`; the server invokes
 *   `open`/`message`/`close` handlers) — use `handleOpen`, `handleMessage`
 *   and `handleClose`, or pass `getWebSocketConfig()` straight into
 *   `Bun.serve({ websocket })`.
 *
 * Nothing here calls `server.upgrade()`: the HTTP route that upgrades a
 * request to a WebSocket belongs to whoever owns the server.
 * `SubscriptionManager.getPath()` exposes the configured
 * `subscriptions.path` so that route can be registered in the right place.
